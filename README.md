# Caesar-Cipher

This application encrypts text entered by the user by shifting each character a set number of letters through the alphabet and returning the resulting scrambled text. The number of steps through the alphabet the cipher shifts each character by can also be specified by the user.

To use the application, open index.html in your browser. Enter your text (no punctuation please) into the first input box and click the "Encrypt" button. This will output the encrypted text. If you want to change the number of characters the cipher is shifting by, change the number in the relevant input box.

Your encrypted text entries and the associated number will automatically be added to the encryption log.

To decrypt the encrypted text, enter it into the middle input box and click decrypt. Ensure you are using the right number for character shifting by checking the entry in the encryption log.

Potential additional features are listed in the file backlog.txt.
